# Assembler_Simulator
The project is written in C++, so you can compile it using any C++ compiler. You will provide a file contaning assembly code, and the script will display the 32 registers' content after every instruction

## User Guide:
1. The first thing is that you will be asked to provide the starting address of the program as a
decimal integer fitting in unsigned 32 bits number and press Enter. 
2. Then, you will be asked if you would like to provide initial memory values through
a memory file. If you would like to do so, put the file in the same directory as described
and type Y, and press Enter.
3. Then, if you wanted to provide an initial memory file, you will be asked about its name
along with the extension. 
4. Then, you will be asked to provide the name of the assembly file with its extension.
5. Lastly, you will be asked to enter which format you want the output in.

After specifying all inputs, you will get the content of all 32 registers after every instruction's execution.
